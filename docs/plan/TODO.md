# Master plan — pfsmgraph

**Status**: active

The two-tier plan convention for this repository:

- **Master plan** — this file, `docs/plan/TODO.md`, lives on `main`. It defines
  **revisions** (milestones) and their **subgoals**; each subgoal spawns a branch.
- **Branch plan** — `docs/plan/<type>-<slug>/TODO.md`, created by `/new-branch`, worked
  by `/hitl-step`, stamped `merged` by `/smart-merge`. It **survives on `main`** as the
  durable record of how a subgoal was executed, and is filed into its revision's
  directory by `/file-plans`.
- **PR body** — the distilled description plus a pointer to the branch plan directory.
  Not a verbatim archive.

`TODO.md` rather than `DO.md` is deliberate: branches inherit the master plan's model,
so every subgoal here runs under `/hitl-step` with its Q&A logged inline. The `dataseq`
merge reconciles three existing implementations and settles a public API that four other
packages depend on — the questions are genuinely open, and the answers are worth keeping.

**Related documents.** Decided-but-not-yet-actionable work is *not* listed here; it lives
in [`DEFERRED.md`](DEFERRED.md), indexed by the trigger that unblocks it. Open design
questions live in [PRD §8](../design/PRD.md) and the `Open` sections of the
[ADRs](../design/adr/README.md). This file tracks only work that is active now.

## Closed revisions

Extracted by `/close-revision` once finished. The subgoals, their `> **Done:**` records,
and the branch plans that executed them all live in the revision's directory.

- **Revision 01-dataseq-v0.1.0** — closed. See `docs/plan/01-dataseq-v0.1.0/_TODO.md`.
